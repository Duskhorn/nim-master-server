# Imprimis Master Server
## Now in Nim!

This strives to be a complete rewrite of [the master server](https://github.com/project-imprimis/master-server) but in Nim, with zero external/libprimis dependencies, just the stdlib.

# Goals

1. Understand the original code
2. Self-document code with comments
3. Make a more manageable version of the current server
4. Show that the dreaded enet lib and tools.h file are not needed
5. (optional) Replace the current master server implementation, eventually

# Why?
> why not.

Jokes aside the original master server is full of spaghetti code and kinda cryptic on what it does.
